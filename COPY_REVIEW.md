**Headline:**
Why this diagnostic matters

**Subheadline:**
Most B2B companies are building growth on broken architecture. They don't have a tactics problem. They have a **system problem**.

   You'll know exactly which constraint to remove first—no more random tactics.

2. **Stop Wasting Budget**
   See which parts of your system are broken before you spend another dollar.

3. **Stop Starting from Zero**
   Get a roadmap to fix your architecture once—then everything compounds.

**Bottom Callout:**
If you're spending $10K+ a month on marketing...
...and don't know your Growth Architecture Score, you're flying blind.

### FAQ Section
**Headline:**
Questions?

**Subheadline:**
Everything you need to know before starting

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: 5–10 minutes. You'll answer 30 questions across 6 categories (Foundation, Architecture, Build, Release, Improve, Compound). No essay questions—just sliding scales.

**Q: Will I get pitched or put into a sales funnel?**
A: No. This is pure diagnostic. You'll get your score, your bottlenecks, and a roadmap. If you want help fixing it, there's a next step. If you don't, you walk away with clarity. That's it.

**Q: What do I get at the end?**
A: Your Growth Architecture Score (0–100), a breakdown of your 3 biggest bottlenecks, a 30-Day Growth System Roadmap (PDF), and a recommended next step based on your score.

**Q: Is this for early-stage companies or established ones?**
A: Both. If you're doing $500K+ in revenue and have some form of go-to-market motion, this diagnostic will show you where it's breaking. If you're earlier, it'll show you what NOT to skip.

**Q: What if my score is low?**
A: Good. That means you're about to stop wasting money on tactics that can't work until you fix your architecture. Low scores get the clearest roadmaps.

**Q: Do I need to know marketing terms or have a technical background?**
A: No. The questions are written in plain English about your growth system. If you run marketing, sales, or growth, you'll be able to answer them.
